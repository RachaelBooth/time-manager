# Time Manager

Yes, it's another application for keeping track of your todo list/time tracking and all that.

It's not even ready for an alpha release yet. There'll be a better readme by then. Anyway.

## What will make this one different?

The key aims here, which I've not yet found (at least not all of them at once) in apps I've used are;

* Be able to track my time and my tasks/todo list from a single app
* Be able to view past time tracking data in a useful way for billing time
* Be able to set up larger tasks and/or tasks that aren't concrete enough to have due dates, and have them show up usefully in lists for planning
* Be able to set up fixed time tasks in a useful way for planning
* Recurring tasks in some useful way
* Be free!
